# Introduction-to-Embedded-Computer-Systems (UVA ECE 3430)

Students are introduced to the architecture of the Texas Instruments MSP 432&nbsp; family of microcontrollers (a Arm Cortex-M4 specifically), on which the lab assignments will be implemented.&nbsp; We have designed and produced a set of plug-in header boards that attach to the MSP 

* The design of information processing systems (running your information through the micro-controller so it performs as desired)
* How to develop a test plan to verify that the implementation you specify satisfies the requirements (how you can guarantee that your information processing system works correctly)
* How to verify the operation the implementation experimentally using both an embedded development platform and standard&nbsp;laboratory&nbsp;equipment like oscilloscopes, multi-meter, function generator, power supply, etc. (implementing your test plan to make sure the system works)

A list of the Learning Activities can be seen below.

## Introduction to Embedded C
You begin the semester with a series of projects to help you learn the C programming language, especially as used within an embedded environment.

## Software-Implemented Finite State Machines
Several assignments deal with the design of a Finite State Machine (FSM), which is then implemented in software. Examples includes debouncing a switch, decoding quadrature encoding sequences, and digital filters.

## Timers and Interrupts
You are introduced to concepts associated with elapsed time using hardware timers, along with the two methods for creating delays in an embedded system - interrupts and polling.

## Pulse Width Modulation
A set of assignments enable the you to explore Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).   You are introduced to PWM by varying the perceived brightness of an LED with a modulated triangle function, that effectively represents the voltage across the LED. You will then use PWM to control the speed of a DC brush motor by implementing a simple closed-loop control scheme.

## Flash memory and Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
One of the custom-designed header boards contains 2 512-Kbit serial flash memory chips accessed via the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocol.   You learn to use the SPI interface to send and receive data from an external flash memory.

## Digital Signal Processing
You will learn how to implement a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) system, which processes digital representations of analog signals using digital filters implemented in software.
