# Introduction-to-Embedded-Computer-Systems (UVA ECE 3430)

Students are introduced to the architecture of the Texas Instruments MSP 432&nbsp;family of microcontrollers, on which the lab assignments will be implemented.&nbsp; We have designed and produced a set of plug-in header boards that attach to the MSP 

* The design of information processing systems (running your information through the micro-controller so it performs as desired)
* How to develop a test plan to verify that the implementation you specify satisfies the requirements (how you can guarantee that your information processing system works correctly)
* How to verify the operation the implementation experimentally using both an embedded development platform and standard&nbsp;laboratory&nbsp;equipment like oscilloscopes, multi-meter, function generator, power supply, etc. (implementing your test plan to make sure the system works)
